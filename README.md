## Todo
- [ ] Finish the `NOISE_XX_AES_128` handshake
  - [x] Reverse the `.proto` file for the structure of the protobuf
  
        This was easy enough in the Debugger where the structure can be viewed quite easily.
        Will put up an image detailing it soon. Possibly make an extract script from it as well.
- [ ] Get the QR
- [ ] Setup the Ratchet
- [ ] Retrieve Messages
